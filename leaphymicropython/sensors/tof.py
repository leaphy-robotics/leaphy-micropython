    Initializes the TimeOfFlight object.

    Tests:
    1. channel=255, no multiplexer, tof sensor connected
    If you disconnect the sensor,
    you should see None (if show_warnings is True, you should see a warning)
    Once you reconnect, you should see valid readings again.

    2. channel=255, no multiplexer, tof sensor not connected
    you should see None (if show_warnings is True, you should see a warning)

    3. channel=between 0 and 7, with multiplexer, tof sensor connected
    If you disconnect the sensor,
    you should see None (if show_warnings is True, you should see a warning)
    Once you reconnect, you should see valid readings again.

    4. channel=between 0 and 7, with multiplexer, tof sensor not connected
    you should see None (if show_warnings is True, you should see a warning)

    Args:
        channel (int, optional): The I2C multiplexer channel to select.
        Defaults to 255, indicating no multiplexer is used.
        sda_gpio_pin (int, optional): The GPIO pin connected to the SDA line. Defaults to 12.
        scl_gpio_pin (int, optional): The GPIO pin connected to the SCL line. Defaults to 13.
        bus_id (int, optional): identifies a particular I2C peripheral, for example bus 0 or 1.
